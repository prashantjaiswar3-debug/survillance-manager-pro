## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Deep charcoal (#222222) for a calming, distraction-free environment.
- Primary color: White (#FFFFFF) for crisp, readable text and clear visual hierarchy.
- Accent color: Subtle dark blue (#304A6A) to provide visual interest without being overly distracting. This dark blue provides good contrast while remaining gentle on the eyes in a dark theme.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif for a modern, neutral, and easily readable UI.
- Use minimalist, monochromatic icons in white (#FFFFFF) to maintain a clean and uncluttered interface.
- Employ a flexible grid layout allowing users to easily drag, drop, and resize widgets. Prioritize ease of use and visual clarity.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations for actions like adding or rearranging widgets. Aim for smooth, non-intrusive feedback.
