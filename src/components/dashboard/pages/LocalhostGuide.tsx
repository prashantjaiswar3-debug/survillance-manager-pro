          This application is running in a development environment provided by
          Firebase Studio. The server is already configured and running for you.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Development Server</h3>
        <p>
          The development server automatically reloads the application when you
          make changes to the code. You can see the server logs and status in
          the terminal window.
        </p>

        <h3>Application Structure</h3>
        <p>
          The application is built with Next.js and React. Key files and folders include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>src/app/page.tsx</strong>: The main entry point of the application.</li>
          <li><strong>src/components/</strong>: Contains all the reusable React components.</li>
          <li><strong>src/app/globals.css</strong>: Global styles for the application.</li>
          <li><strong>public/</strong>: Static assets like images and fonts.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Next Steps</h3>
        <p>
          You can continue to modify the application by asking for new features,
          pages, or components. For example, you could ask to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Add a new chart to the dashboard.</li>
          <li>Implement a new data table with sorting and filtering.</li>
          <li>Integrate with a third-party API.</li>
        </ul>
